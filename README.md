# TenderFlow v4.0

> AI-Powered Tender Intelligence Agent - Full-Stack Platform

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.11+**
- **Node.js 20+**
- **MySQL 8.0+**
- **Google Gemini API Key**

---

### 1. Clone & Set Up Backend

```powershell
# Navigate to server directory
cd server

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Copy and fill in environment variables
copy .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your MySQL credentials and Gemini API key
```

### 2. Set Up Frontend

```powershell
cd client
npm install
```

### 3. Set Up Database

Create MySQL database:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE tenderflow_v4 CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
```

Tables are **auto-created** from SQLAlchemy models on first server start (no migrations needed for dev).

### 4. Start Development Servers

**Option A** - Double-click `start_dev.bat` (Windows)

**Option B** - Manual:
```powershell
# Terminal 1 - Backend
cd server
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000

# Terminal 2 - Frontend
cd client
npm run dev
```

- **Frontend**: http://localhost:5173  
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:8000  
- **API Docs (Swagger)**: http://localhost:8000/docs

### Laya AI in qualification scoring

TenderFlow can use the local Laya decision model to classify tender-side requirements across all seven qualifier dimensions: financial strength, domain experience, technical capability, certifications and registrations, legal standing, geographic alignment, and DEI. The resulting requirement signals are stored in `TenderDetails.Requirements_JSON` and included in dimension notes; detected tender-required certificates are also used as the primary certificate-match set. The existing deterministic profile-based point formulas, weights, subject-fail thresholds, hard-disqualification rules, and verdict thresholds remain authoritative. Laya signals are probabilistic and should be validated against real tenders; a low probability means “not detected,” not proof that a requirement is absent.

Set `REQUIREMENTS_BACKEND=laya` in `server/.env` to enable it (`laya` is now the default). The first Laya call may download a large model checkpoint. Use `REQUIREMENTS_BACKEND=off` to disable it, or `gemini` to use the existing Gemini classifier instead.

## Laya-assisted qualification scoring

When `REQUIREMENTS_BACKEND=laya`, TenderFlow first classifies tender-side requirement signals and stores source-sentence evidence in `Requirements_JSON`. The qualifier then asks the local Laya classifier to assess the seven fixed scoring factors against the tender evidence and available company profile. Factor scores are clamped to each factor's configured point ceiling; explanations include the source snippets found in the tender and the matching company-profile facts, and explicitly call out missing evidence. The Tender Browser exposes requirement evidence on chip hover and factor-scoring notes on dimension-row hover. If Laya factor scoring fails or returns incomplete results, the qualifier logs the failure and falls back to the existing deterministic scorers.

Python remains authoritative for score aggregation, hard disqualifiers, per-factor minimum thresholds, verdict selection, `QUAL_GATE` rules, and email gating. The current dimension ceilings sum to 190 points, so aggregation is normalized onto the existing 200-point verdict scale before applying the existing thresholds. Laya probabilities are model estimates, not calibrated probabilities or proof of eligibility; review the supporting tender clauses and company records before acting on a result.

## Laya full-tender evidence pass (October 2026)

When Laya scoring is enabled, the qualifier now builds tender evidence from:

1. The stored tender title and description.
2. The public tender landing page in `Website_URL` (when reachable).
3. Up to five linked PDF attachments on the same host as that page.

Searchable PDF text is extracted with PyMuPDF. The complete collected text is scanned for clauses relevant to each of the seven scoring factors; each Laya factor assessment receives multiple relevant clauses found across the document and the company profile. This replaces the old 1,200-character keyword-selected description window and the single-snippet-per-factor input. The final verdict and hard disqualifier handling remain in Python.

Safety/reliability notes: page/PDF fetching is bounded by time and file size, private/local URLs are rejected, only same-host PDF links are followed, and fetch failures fall back to the stored description. Image-only/scanned PDFs are not OCR'd by this change; OCR would need to be added separately. Verify that the source portal exposes its attachments as same-host links. The database's saved `Description` alone cannot guarantee a complete tender if the source website or PDF is inaccessible.

Validation performed in this change: Python compile check passed; 13 focused tests passed (`test_tender_document_reader.py`, `test_laya_qualification.py`, `test_tender_requirements.py`). Live portal fetching and Azure database integration were not tested here.
